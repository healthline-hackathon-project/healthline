The HealthLine project is an innovative healthcare platform designed to provide users with personalized health insights and easy access to medical facilities. The platform is aimed at empowering users with tools to assess their health risks, find hospital beds, and get real-time health advice from an AI-powered chatbot. Built using HTML, CSS, and Python Flask for the backend, HealthLine integrates advanced features like AI chatbots and health risk calculators, providing a seamless experience for users looking to monitor their health and make informed decisions.

Key Features of HealthLine: AI Chatbot for Health Assistance The platform features an intelligent AI chatbot that assists users with general health concerns. Integrated with the Gemini API, the chatbot helps users determine whether they need to visit a doctor, providing advice based on user input. It serves as a first-level support system for common health issues.

Health Risk Calculators Users can assess their health status with risk calculators available on HealthLine. These calculators currently include a Heart Risk Calculator and a BMI Calculator. Users answer simple questions, and the calculators analyze the responses to provide health risk assessments, helping individuals make proactive decisions regarding their health.

Hospital Bed Availability Checker One of the platformâ€™s standout features is the Hospital Bed Availability Checker. This tool allows users to search for hospitals based on their location and medical condition. It provides real-time updates on available beds, prices, and other details, helping users find suitable hospitals nearby. Users can also send their details to hospitals for direct admission.

User Registration & Login To personalize the experience, HealthLine includes a user registration and login feature, powered by Flask-Login. Users can create an account to access features like saving health assessments and managing health records. Registration is optional, but it allows users to store their health history for future reference.

Health Blogs & FAQs The platform offers a blog section with regularly updated content about common diseases, prevention tips, and general health advice. Users can stay informed about seasonal diseases and their prevention. There is also a dedicated FAQ page that answers common questions about using the platform and health-related concerns.
