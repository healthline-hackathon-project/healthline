    <h3>3. Enhances Cognitive Function</h3>
    <p>Physical activity can enhance brain function and cognitive abilities. Studies suggest that exercise improves memory, attention, and problem-solving skills, which can contribute to better academic and professional performance.</p>

    <h3>4. Promotes Better Sleep</h3>
    <p>Physical activity can help regulate sleep patterns and improve sleep quality. Better sleep can lead to improved mood and mental clarity during waking hours.</p>
