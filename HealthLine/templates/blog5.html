    <h2>Benefits of Physical Activity</h2>
    <p>Regular physical activity provides a multitude of benefits, including:</p>

    <h3>1. Improved Cardiovascular Health</h3>
    <p>Engaging in aerobic exercises like walking, running, or cycling strengthens the heart, improves circulation, and lowers blood pressure, reducing the risk of heart disease.</p>

    <h3>2. Weight Management</h3>
    <p>Physical activity burns calories, helping to maintain a healthy weight or lose weight when combined with a balanced diet. It boosts metabolism and reduces body fat.</p>

    <h3>3. Enhanced Mental Health</h3>
    <p>Exercise has been shown to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins, which enhance mood and promote a sense of well-being.</p>

    <h3>4. Stronger Muscles and Bones</h3>
    <p>Regular weight-bearing exercise increases muscle strength and bone density, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures as we age.</p>
